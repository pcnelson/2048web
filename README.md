The modified game adds:
* an "AI Play" button to toggle automated play
* Ctrl-X also toggles automated play
* X makes a single automated move

The automated player is implemented as a web service at ai.py on
the game host that is passed info about the game's current state and
returns a text response with the first line oneof up,left,right,down
and the second line as an optional message.

Arguments to the ai service include
*  ai     which algorithm to use (specified on the url to the game)
*  arg    optional args for the algo (also specified on the url to the game)
*  gid    id of game, autogenerated by the client
*  score  current score
*  board  current board, by row in format "4,2,0,0, 4,0,0,0, 0,0,0,0, 0,0,0,0"
*  prior  recent prior moves as string (e.g. "udlr" where 'u' was the most recent move)
*  drop   cell dropped by game after last move as [row, col, value] (e.g. "1,0,4")
