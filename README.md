# 2048
A derivation of [2048] by https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048 that adds automated play.

Play the modified version here:
* http://2048.calebn.com
* http://2048.calebn.com/game.htm?ai=rand&arg=

The modified game adds:
* an "AI Play" button or Control-X to toggle automated play
* X to make a single automated move
* a log window of moves and messages from the AI

The automated player is implemented as a web service at ai.py on the
game host that's passed info about the game's current state and
returns a text response with the first line oneof up,left,right,down
and the second line as an optional message.

Probe the web service here:
http://2048.calebn.com/ai/ai.py?ai=left&score=228&board=32,16,8,2,16,4,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,2,0,0&prior=lullll&drop=3,1,2

Arguments to the ai service include
*  ai     which algorithm to use (specified on the url to the game)
*  arg    optional args for the algo (also specified on the url to the game)
*  gid    id of game, autogenerated by the client
*  score  current score
*  board  current board, by row in format "4,2,0,0, 4,0,0,0, 0,0,0,0, 0,0,0,0"
*  prior  recent prior moves as string (e.g. "udlr" where 'u' was the most recent move)
*  drop   cell dropped by game after last move as [row, col, value] (e.g. "1,0,4")
